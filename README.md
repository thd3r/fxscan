## About

**Fxscan** is an xss scanning tool with an accuracy rate of 94% with this tool you can scan your target accurately because this tool was created using the [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) library which is able to accurately identify whether an xss appears on a page. Why is the accuracy 94%? due to 5% for non-vulnerable targets and 1% for small errors made by the tool itself

## Acknowledgement

Because the **airixss** and **freq** tools have the weakness of not being able to detect whether xss is actually triggered or not. I created the **fxscan** tool to fix that problem. I'll publically thank the following users for their helps and resources:

* [@ferreiraklet/airixss](https://github.com/ferreiraklet/airixss)
* [@takshal/freq](https://github.com/takshal/freq)
